Work in progress! View [here](https://completionism.herokuapp.com/).

#### What?
Users can import their character data from the World of Warcraft API, and then view their collections and see what's missing, where to obtain it etc. The aim is to make how the data is viewed, filtered etc. as customisable as possible.

#### How?
You can import a character's collection by clicking the user icon to the right of any category (this will be made clearer in the future). Once imported you can click on the category to view the collection. Try importing the following for the mounts category: 
- EU
- Realm: Sylvanas
- Name: Knoxis
